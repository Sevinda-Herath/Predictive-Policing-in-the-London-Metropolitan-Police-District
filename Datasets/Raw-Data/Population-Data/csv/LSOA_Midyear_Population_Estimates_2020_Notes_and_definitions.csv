Lower Layer Super Output Areas
Super Output Areas (SOAs) form a geographic hierarchy designed to improve the reporting of small area statistics in England and Wales. Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) are 
"built from groups of 2011 Census Output Areas (OAs), typically 4 to 6, and designed to have a population of between 1,000 and 3,000 persons. These LSOAs nest within Middle Layer"
"Super Output Areas (MSOAs), there are typically 4 to 5 LSOAs within a MSOA."
""
"There are 34,753 LSOAs in England and Wales (32,844 in England, 1,909 in Wales) and they were generated by a computer program which merged OAs taking into account measures"
"population size, mutual proximity and social homogeneity. These boundaries have been revised following the results of the 2011 Census and were released to the public in October 2012."

1. These figures are consistent with the published mid-2020 local authority population estimates.
2. It is ONS policy to publish population estimates rounded to at least the nearest hundred persons. These unit-level estimates are provided to enable and encourage further calculations
"    and anyalysis. However, the estimates cannot be guranteed to be as exact as the level of detail implied by unit-level data. We request that data are rounded to the nearest 100 if "
"    quoted in any publication, documentation or similar."
"3. The estimated resident population of an area includes all those people who usually live there, regardless of nationality. Arriving international migrants are included in the usually resident "
    population if they remain in the UK for at least a year. Emigrants are excluded if they remain outside the UK for at least a year. This is consistent with the United Nations definition of a 
    long-term migrant. Armed forces stationed outside of the UK are excluded. Students are taken to be usually resident at their term time address.
4. These estimates are subject to statistical disclosure control. The general application of statistical disclosure control ensures that information attributable to an individual or organisation 
    is not  disclosed in any publication.
5. Note that age 90 comprises data for ages 90 and above.
